# Chicago_City_Analysis-

Final assignment of the course called "Databases and SQL for Data Science using Python". The programming language used here was Python with SQL statements, connected with relational database in IBM Cloud by the API "ibm_db".

### The Set of Data
1. **Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators**
    This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a hardship index, by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 â€“ 2012.

2. **Chicago Public Schools**
    This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.

3. **Chicago Crime Data**
    This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.
    
 ### Instructions
1. **Review the datasets**
2. **Load the datasets into a database**

    Perform this step using the LOAD tool in the Db2 console. You will need to create 3 tables in the database, one for each dataset, named as follows, and then load the respective .CSV file into the table:

        CENSUS_DATA

        CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS

        CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA


3. **Write and execute queries**

    Perform this step in the Jupyter notebook provided in the previous section. Carefully read and understand each problem. Compose and execute the appropriate SQL queries to answer each of the problems. Take a screenshot of each query and its results and save it as a jpg file.. 
    
    Problem 1: Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.
    
    Problem 2: List community areas with per capita income less than 11000.
    
    Problem 3: List all case numbers for crimes involving minors?
    
    Problem 4: List all kidnapping crimes involving a child?(children are not considered minors for the purposes of crime analysis)
    
    Problem 5: What kind of crimes were recorded at schools?
    
    Problem 6: List the average safety score for all types of schools.
    
    Problem 7: List 5 community areas with highest % of households below poverty line.      
    
    Problem 8: Which community area(number) is most crime prone?
    
    Problem 9: Use a sub-query to find the name of the community area with highest hardship index.
    
    Problem 10: Use a sub-query to determine the Community Area Name with most number of crimes?
